function [t2a, numPass] = passTasks_v4(t2a, agents, tasks, simTh, numPass, agdistmat, stuckag)
%% Description
% This function performs reorganization of which agent works on which task.
%
% In this version stuck agents ask all their friends (not engaged or stuck, leaving out busy agent friends) if they can solve the task of the stuck
% agent. If not, bummer, nothing happens, agent does not pass and stays in the stuck state. If yes, they pass on their task. If the receiving agent is
% also a stuck agent, their tasks are swapped. If the receiving agent is an empty agent, the empty agent becomes the task solver and the original
% stuck agent becomes empty.
%
% Question to myself: what shall happen to a task when numPass (which is not used now) is reached? The agent is stuck forever? -- In current version
% this is what happens.
