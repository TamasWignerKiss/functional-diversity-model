function [t2a, taskhist, stepNo] = PassingSolveTasks(agents, tasks, etc, agdistmat, simTh)
%This function runs an instance of the simulation. In this version the simulation runs until the maximal number of steps is reached or all tasks are
%solved. The following processes are performed:
%1. Randomly assign tasks to agents (also, keep track of the assignment across stimulation steps)
%2. Figure out if tasks are to be passed around using the current rule
%3. Agents not in refractory work on the task
%4. Free agents re-assigned to task
%5. Go to step 2 unless maximum number of steps reached or all tasks solved.
%
% Input arguments:
% agents: is the agents matrix
% tasks: is the task matrix
% etc: other parameters, a struct containing:
%   emStop: a number that specifies the maximum number of steps allowed (to stop simulation in case the system gets stuck)
%   maxPass: maximum number of allowable passes
%   passCost: the number of steps an agent has to wait to do any work after receiving a task
%   NoPassInRef: a switch to tell if passing during refractory is allowed or not
% agdistmat: distance matrix -- pre-calculated for effective computation
% simTh: a threshold of similarity (percent of max) above which agents don't pass
