function [t2a, numPass] = passTasks_v2(t2a, agents, tasks, simTh, numPass, agdistmat, dai, npir)
%This function performs reorganization of which agent works on which task. This is version 2 because in the old version weird things could happen. For
%example if Agent A was working on Task 1 and Agent B was working on Task 2 and both of them were stuck, they could not exchange tasks, since they
%were both showing up as busy for the other agent.
%
%In the current version all agents that communicate first evaluate which is better in solving a given task. This way for each task a list of agents
%are assigned. Second, tasks are assigned to agents in order of their fitness. If there are tasks that do not have any optional agents, tasks are
%returned to the central pool and randomly re-assigned to idle agents.
%
%Even though the idea was that non-communicating agents do not share information, still, in an indirect way, they do communicate. This is because in
%the fitness table, that lists how much work a given agent is able to do on a given task, the fittest agent is assigned to the new task first. This
%sort of assumes an all-to-all communication, even if only implicitly.

%Usage: [Task2Agent, NumberOfPasses] = pasTasks(Task2Agent, Agents, Tasks, SimilarityThreshold, NumberOfPasses)
